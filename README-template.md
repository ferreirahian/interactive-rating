## Overview

First challenge using javascript, although I had little knowlodge about it and some logic knowlodge, apllying it was a little bit harder then I tought.

with some videos and research I was able to put it together, now I plan to review it sometimes before trying the next challenge.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating


## My process

Started with the HTML and design, tried using buttons from Bootstrap but using them as LI's proved way better. Had some hard time designing with two boxes on screen, but will get used to it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Javascript


### What I learned

Adding event listeners, still have to study more about it. Reading inner html and triggering events by clicks was something that I did know about, but had a nice review on how to use it.

### Continued development

Important project to start developing my javascript, will look forward to hone it.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQnUopEeZgw&t=260s&ab_channel=TsbSankara) - Couldn't get the javascript without the help of this video, also nice option on the buttons on LI, had forgotten about it.
- [Example resource 2](Stack Overflow) - No specific topic, but placing the script lower on the code made it work, it was not reading my consts before.
